    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; We extracted three different CSV&rsquo;s from the website </span><a href="https://data.world"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data.world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to find a correlation between airports, airlines and routes in the United States.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We imported the </span><strong>CSV</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s to Jupyter lab and transform it into three working dataframes by cleaning, filtering, dropping null cells and connecting duplicates like the the </span><strong>IATA </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the </span><strong>ICAO</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> code</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are unique for each airport.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Another relationship with the airport table could be established through the <strong>airport_id</strong> field and the <strong>airline_id</strong> field to make the connection with the routes table needed to make the connection into Postgres database</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">after that, all 3 tables were joined into 1 large table that visualizes the correlation in between all three dataframes. Then exported into HTML format to be integrated into the website.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why we chose this?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airports are essential for the economic development of any place. They improve communications, promote job creation, generate economic activity and revalue the environment, so it would be of great importance to organize and analyze their data.</span></p>
