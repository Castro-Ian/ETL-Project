#an inside look of the Data of Airpotrs, Airlines and Routes
Project Members: Sam Azhari, Alciluz Gomez & Ian Castro
in this Project, we will extract the data of airpots, airlines and routes from public source such as data.world and kaggle.com

we will be using Pandas and Jupyter lab to clean the data to only include airports operations in the US. Some additional data that we will be using are the airports codes (IATA) as the primary key that will assist us in making an engine connection through Jupyter lab to push the data into our Postgres database so we can create an accurate database.

After all the data process, we will create an ERD Diagram with each table primary key and its relationship to other tables. We then will take all the data collected and publish it on a website that will include in addition to our proposal, a more indepth details on how the project was completed, the steps taken and a the Final results.
