**ETL Project Proposal 

Title: US Aviation

Group members: Sam Azhari, Alciluz Gomez & Ian Castro 

We are pulling 3 sets of data from data.world about airports, routes and airlines.

we will be using panda/jupyter to clean the data to only include US airports operations

we will be using the airports codes (IATA) as the the primary key

we will be making an engine connection through jupyter to push our data into our postgres database after we create the database and 3 tables with each respective columns

Afterwards, we will create an ERD to show the content of each table, along with its Primary key and its relationship to other tables.

Finally, we will take all the data collected and publish them on a website that will include in addition to our proposal a 3 links for the sets of data that we worked on along with a page for the ERD graph.
